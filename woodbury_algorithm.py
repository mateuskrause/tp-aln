def woodbury_algorithm(A, ur, ll, b, k):
    '''
    Solve a cyclic banded linear system with upper right
    and lower blocks of size ``(k-1) / 2`` using
    the Woodbury formula

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : 2-D array, shape(k, n)
        Matrix of diagonals of original matrix (see
        ``solve_banded`` documentation).
    ur : 2-D array, shape(bs, bs)
        Upper right block matrix.
    ll : 2-D array, shape(bs, bs)
        Lower left block matrix.
    b : 1-D array, shape(n,)
        Vector of constant terms of the system of linear equations.
    k : int
        B-spline degree.

    Returns
    -------
    c : 1-D array, shape(n,)
        Solution of the original system of linear equations.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm works only for systems with banded matrix A plus
    a correction term U @ V.T, where the matrix U @ V.T gives upper right
    and lower left block of A
    The system is solved with the following steps:
        1.  New systems of linear equations are constructed:
            A @ z_i = u_i,
            u_i - column vector of U,
            i = 1, ..., k - 1
        2.  Matrix Z is formed from vectors z_i:
            Z = [ z_1 | z_2 | ... | z_{k - 1} ]
        3.  Matrix H = (1 + V.T @ Z)^{-1}
        4.  The system A' @ y = b is solved
        5.  x = y - Z @ (H @ V.T @ y)
    Also, ``n`` should be greater than ``k``, otherwise corner block
    elements will intersect with diagonals.

    Examples
    --------
    Consider the case of n = 8, k = 5 (size of blocks - 2 x 2).
    The matrix of a system:       U:          V:
      x  x  x  *  *  a  b         a b 0 0     0 0 1 0
      x  x  x  x  *  *  c         0 c 0 0     0 0 0 1
